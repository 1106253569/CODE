I am the sun!
I am the Emperor of Heaven!
Break the darkness with thunder!
TEndless journeys are long, and storms follow.
Towards the road of light, doomed to thorns.
How can the world be as it should be, but ask for a clear conscience.
Never wander around.
Anything that doesn't break us will only make us stronger!
The Light God has fallen, and now it is the Light that leads me!
This sword, when chopped, is awarded by the demons!
The more weapons you have, the more powerful you become!
